    <li>"For behold, thus saith the Lord God: I will give unto the children of men line upon line, aprecept upon precept, here a little and there a little; and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall learn bwisdom; for unto him that creceiveth I will give dmore; and from them that shall say, We have enough, from them shall be taken away even that which they have."
      <br>-2 Nephi 28:30</li>
    <li>"“Heavenly Father, I’m on Thy errand; this is Thy church. I have spoken words that came not from me, but from Thee and Thy Son. Wilt Thou, therefore, fulfill the promise in the lives of this noble people.” There coursed through my mind the words from the psalm, “Be still, and know that I am God.”11 The heavenly virtue of patience was required."

	<li>"Patience, that heavenly virtue, had brought to humble Saints its heaven-sent reward. The words of Rudyard Kipling’s “Recessional” seemed so fitting:

<br>The tumult and the shouting dies;

<br>The captains and the kings depart.

<br>Still stands thine ancient sacrifice,

<br>An humble and a contrite heart.

<br>Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,

<br>Lest we forget, lest we forget."
		<br>-Thomas S Monson
