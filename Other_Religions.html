	<h3> Baptist Beliefs:</h3>
	<p>"Who is God? He is the divine being, infinite, without beginning or end, Spirit and not mere energy or force. (John 4:24) He relates to, and redeems, human beings, people like you and me. God is and has been eternally One and God in three persons. (Ex. 3:14-15; 20:1-2; Isa. 43:3; Matt. 23:9; John 17:1-5)

Can God be known? We can know what God is like, but we cannot know everything about God. Put another way, we cannot know God exhaustively.  If we could, what kind of God would He be? Nevertheless, and more importantly, we can know God truly! (Phil. 3:10) This cannot be accomplished, nor experienced through study and intellectual understanding alone, but by obedience and faith. He is not an object to be merely studied, but the One to be obeyed, loved and worshipped. (Matt.  22:24; Acts 5:29; Heb. 12:28-29) If there is any aspect of our beliefs that must be approached with reverence, awe, humility and prayer, it is our understanding of God, and no other belief could be more important.

What is God like? God has a nature, an essence and attributes. God is holy (I Pet. 1:16), which means that He is both distinct from what He has created and morally pure. As a moral being, He is righteous and just. One who hates sin and judges it, but forgives sinners. He is love. (I John 4:8) His love is not sentimental in a merely human sense, but love in fulfillment of His covenant with us, sacrificial and self-giving and personal. He has many more attributes, and they are all perfect."

	<h3>Catholic</h3>
	<p>"The core beliefs of the Catholic faith are found in the Nicene Creed. Here’s what it says:

I believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible.
 
I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten Son of God, born of the Father before all ages. God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father; through him all things were made. For us men and for our salvation he came down from heaven, and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary, and became man. For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate, he suffered death and was buried, and rose again on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures. He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead and his kingdom will have no end.
 
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son, who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified who has spoken through the prophets.
 
I believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church. I confess one Baptism for the forgiveness of sins and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come. Amen."

	<h3>Jewish</h3>
	<p>"In Judaism, the idea of God as a duality or trinity is heretical — it is even considered by some polytheistic.[7] According to Judaic beliefs, the Torah rules out a trinitarian God in Deuteronomy (6:4): "Hear Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is one.""
		<br>"Maimonides' thirteen principles of faith includes the concept that God has no body and that physical concepts do not apply to him.[11] In the "Yigdal" prayer, found towards the beginning of the Jewish prayer books used in synagogues around the world, it states "He has no semblance of a body nor is He corporeal". It is a central tenet of Judaism that God does not have any physical characteristics;[12] that God's essence cannot be fathomed."
