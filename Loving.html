  <p>"Let no man count them as small things; for there is much which lieth in futurity, pertaining to the saints, which depends upon these things.<br>

16 You know, brethren, that a very large ship is abenefited very much by a very small helm in the time of a storm, by being kept workways with the wind and the waves.<br>

17 Therefore, dearly beloved brethren, let us acheerfully bdo all things that lie in our power; and then may we stand still, with the utmost assurance, to see the csalvation of God, and for his arm to be revealed.<br>
	  -D&C 123:16
	  *Heavenly Father is in control of the storms in our lives, and as we trust in Him and do the little things that Hea asks us to do, He is able to make that storm blow us in the direction He needs us to go.</p>
